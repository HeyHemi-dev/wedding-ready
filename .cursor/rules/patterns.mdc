# Next.js Best Practices

## Folders and Files
- Use the App Router directory structure
- Place components in `app` directory for route-specific components
- Place shared components in `components` directory
- Place utilities and helpers in `utils` directory
- Use kebab case for files and directories. e.g. `components/directory-name/file-name.tsx`

## Type Safety
- Always specify the return type (exception allowed for React components that only return JSX)
- Types always start with a capital letter
- Model type naming: 
   - `[model]Raw` e.g. `TileRaw` shape of data directly from a row in a table. Must only be used in operations layer and below.
   - `Insert[model]Raw` e.g. `InsertTileRaw` shape of data for creating a row in a table.
   - `Set[model]Raw` e.g. `SetTileRaw` shape of data for updating a row in a table. Removes fields that should not be updated (e.g. 'id', createdAt etc.)
- API type naming: 
   - `[endpoint]RequestBody` e.g. `createTileRequestBody`
   - `[endpoint]ResponseBody` e.g. `createTileResponseBody`
- Frontend types:

## Server/Client Separation
- Use server components where possible for reduced client-side JavaScript
- Mark client components explicitly with 'use client'
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Data Fetching
- Use Server Components for data fetching when possible
- If fetching in client component, use useQuery
- Implement proper error handling for data fetching
- Handle loading and error states appropriately
- Use tryCatch util function [try-catch.ts](mdc:utils/try-catch.ts)

## Forms
- Prefer server-side rendered forms and form actions where possible. Only use client-side forms when necessary.
- Define the action on the form element rather than the button.
- Use react-hook-form and Zod for form validation
- Implement proper server-side validation
- Wrap inputs with Field component. [field.tsx](mdc:components/form/field.tsx)
- Use Shadcn sonner for UX

## State Management
- Minimize client-side state
- Use React Context sparingly
- Prefer server state when possible

## Styling
- Use tailwind classes
- Use shadcn components when possible. If the component doesn't exist, ask the user to install it with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest`
- Prefer grid over flex. Only use flex for items that should gather to the start or end in 1 dimension. e.g. badges, button groups etc. Everything else should use grid for layout.



# Modern React/Next.js development
Look for opportunties to take advantage of new hooks in React 19 and Next.JS 15.

## Recent React additions:
- `useId`: Generates unique IDs for consistent client and server rendering. ​
- `useTransition`: Manages UI transitions, allowing differentiation between urgent and non-urgent updates. ​
- `useDeferredValue`: Defers updating non-urgent parts of the UI, improving responsiveness during high-priority updates. ​
- Actions: Simplify asynchronous state updates by allowing the use of async functions directly in transitions, automatically handling pending states, errors, and optimistic updates. ​
- `useActionState`: Simplifies managing form states and submissions by capturing form input data, handling validation, and managing error states, reducing the need for custom state management
- `useFormStatus`: Provides information about a form's submission status, useful for displaying loading indicators or disabling submit buttons during submission. ​
- `useOptimistic`: Manages optimistic UI updates, allowing immediate UI feedback while awaiting server confirmation. ​
- `use`: Simplifies reading resources like promises during rendering, enabling components to suspend until the promise resolves. ​

## Recent Next.JS additions:
- Server Actions and Mutations: Simplify server-side data manipulation by allowing functions to run directly on the server, reducing the need for separate API routes.
- Asynchronous Request-Specific APIs: APIs like cookies, headers, params, and searchParams are now asynchronous, enhancing performance and flexibility. ​
- New `<Form>` Component: Enhances HTML forms with client-side navigation and prefetching, improving user experience. ​



# Performance

## React render performance and avoid unnecessary re-renders. 
- Minimize use of 'useEffect' and 'setState'
- Use memoization wisely (`useMemo` and `useCallback`). -
Lift state only when necessary. 
- Avoid storing derived data in state if it can be computed dynamically. 
- Keep components granular to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

## Optimize Next.js data fetching. 
- Use server components where possible to keep data-fetching efficient (but also understand when things should be run on client). 
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Offload auth checks to middleware instead of full server responses.

## Reduce network latency. 
- The database (and auth) is on Supbase so optimise Drizzle queries and only fetch the data you need. 
- Use pagination (`limit` & `offset`) for tiles and supplier tables. 
- Cache results where applicable (useQuery). 
- Avoid making Supabase auth calls on every render.

## Images
- Optimize images before upload. 
- Resize, compress, and generate smaller copies (300w, 450w, 600w, 900w) of images on client-side before upload.

## Optimise client-side. 
- Use Suspense and caching (useQuery) if appropriate to provide a good UX. 
- Use optimistic updates for mutations. 
- Use skeleton screens instead of spinners for better UX.
- Use srcset and lazy loading on image tags. 
- Import only what you need (e.g., import { function } from "library" instead of import * as library from "library").



# Clean Code Guidelines

## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file [constants.ts](mdc:db/constants.ts)

## Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

## Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Version Control
- Write clear commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names
