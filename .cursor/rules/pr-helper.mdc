# Pull request helper

- Review the latest version of the pull request template [pull_request_template.md](mdc:docs/pull_request_template.md)
- Review the gif diff against the main branch

- Ask the user to run `pmpm lint` in the terminal. Wait for this to complete so you can see the current lint errors
- Ask the user if they would like to update documentation in `/docs`. If yes read that folder and look for anything that needs to be updated.

- Draft the description section for this pull request
- Be concise. If the change is small, the description can be small.
- Use markdown formatting in a codeblock
- If no unit tests have been added or changed, do not write anything under the testing section.
- Do not fill out the checklist.
