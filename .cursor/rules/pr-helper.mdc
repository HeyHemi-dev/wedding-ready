# Pull request helper

- Review the latest version of the pull request template [pull_request_template.md](mdc:docs/pull_request_template.md)
- Review the gif diff against the main branch

- Always ask the user to run `pmpm lint` in the terminal, even if it has just been run. Wait for this to complete so you can see any current lint errors.
- Always ask the user if they would like to update documentation in `/docs`. If yes, read that folder and look for anything that needs to be updated.

- ONLY draft the description section for this pull request.
- Do not draft any other sections e.g. testing, checklists, etc.
- Be concise. If the change is small, the description can be small.
- Use markdown formatting in a codeblock.
