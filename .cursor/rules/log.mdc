## Logging

- When asked to log changes. Make sure to grab date and time first everytime.
- Maintain a cursor-log.md file in docs/
- Log format should be:

***markdown
## [DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS]

- Change description 1
- Additional details or context
- Change description 2
- File path affected
- Nature of change .. ..

- Each log entry should include:
- Date and time of changes in [DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS] format
- To get the correct timestamp:
1. Run 'date "+%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%"* in the terminal
2. Use the exact output in the log header format: ' ## [DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS]*
- Bullet points for each change made
- Relevant file paths and descriptions
- Context or reasoning when necessary
- Group related changes under a single timestamp
- Keep logs organized chronologically
- Use clear, concise descriptions
- Include enough detail for future reference
- Separate different days with clear headers
- Use yarn as the package manager for installing dependencies.
