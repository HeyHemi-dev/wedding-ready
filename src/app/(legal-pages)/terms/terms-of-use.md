## The Service

Wedding Ready helps couples discover inspiration for their wedding and connect with suppliers (such as photographers, venues, florists, stylists, and other vendors). To do this, we show you content we think will be relevant and interesting based on your activity on Wedding Ready and, where permitted, off our platform. Some of this content is created by suppliers and other users, and some may be promoted or sponsored.

To provide the Service, we need to be able to identify you, your account, your preferences, and some details about your wedding plans. Our collection and use of personal information is described in our Privacy Policy.

We use information about how you use Wedding Ready to recommend tiles and suppliers that we think you will find useful. We may also show you sponsored or promoted content in similar places to other content, but it will be labelled or otherwise identifiable as promotional.

You may not use the Service to do or share anything that is contrary to these Terms or to applicable law.

## Using Wedding Ready

### Who can use Wedding Ready

You may use Wedding Ready only if you can form a binding contract under the laws of New Zealand, or if you are using the Service with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian.

Any use of Wedding Ready by anyone under the age of 13 is not allowed. If you are 13 to 17 years old, you may only use the Service with the permission of your parent or legal guardian. By allowing a person under 18 to use the Service, the parent or legal guardian agrees to these Terms on that person’s behalf.

We may ask you to provide reasonable proof of your age, or of a parent or legal guardian’s consent, if we have concerns about underage use.

When you create an account, you must provide us with accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date.

If we have previously disabled or suspended your account for breaching these Terms, our other policies, or for legal reasons, you must not create another account without our express written permission.

### Your licence to use the Service

Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms and our policies, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable licence to access and use Wedding Ready for your personal, non-commercial use (for couples and guests) or for your business use (for suppliers) as contemplated by these Terms.

You must not:

- copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works from the Service, except to the extent this cannot be restricted under applicable law
- use any automated means (including bots, scrapers, crawlers, or similar tools) to access, extract, download, or index content from the Service without our prior written consent
- attempt to access data you do not have permission to access or to interfere with the proper operation of the Service.

All rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by us and our licensors.

### Supplier and business use of Wedding Ready

If you use Wedding Ready as a supplier (for example, a business, company, or sole trader listing services or uploading content to promote those services), you represent and warrant that:

- you are authorised to bind the business or entity you act for
- you will use the Service only for lawful business purposes and in accordance with these Terms and our policies
- all information you provide about your services, pricing, and availability is accurate, up to date, and not misleading
- you will ensure that your use of Wedding Ready and all claims you make about your services comply with all advertising, consumer protection, and fair trading laws that apply to you in New Zealand (including the Fair Trading Act 1986 and, where applicable, the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993).

We may offer additional supplier or business-specific terms, guidelines, or policies from time to time. Where those conflict with these Terms, the more specific supplier or business terms will apply to your business use to the extent of the conflict.

### Prohibited conduct

In using Wedding Ready, you agree that you will not:

- scrape, harvest, or collect information from Wedding Ready (including supplier information or contact details) for any purpose that is unrelated to planning or delivering a wedding or related event
- bulk-download images or other content from the Service
- use the Service to send unsolicited commercial messages or spam
- attempt to bypass or interfere with any security, rate-limiting, or access controls that we apply
- use the Service to engage in any unlawful, misleading, deceptive, or harmful activity.

Any use of Wedding Ready that is not expressly permitted by these Terms is a breach of these Terms and may violate intellectual property and other laws.

## Your Content

### Posting User Content

Wedding Ready allows you to post or upload content, including photos, videos, text, reviews, comments, supplier profiles, and other materials ("User Content"). Anything that you post, upload, or otherwise make available on the Service is User Content.

You retain all rights of ownership in your User Content. However, you are solely responsible for the User Content you post on Wedding Ready, including ensuring that it complies with these Terms and with applicable law.

You agree that:

- you will only upload or post User Content that you have the necessary rights and permissions to use and share
- you will not post User Content that infringes or violates any third-party rights, including copyright, trade mark, privacy, or publicity rights
- you have obtained all necessary permissions and consents from any person who appears in your User Content (including from a parent or legal guardian for any person under 18)
- your User Content will not be defamatory, obscene, hateful, threatening, harassing, discriminatory, or otherwise offensive, and will not encourage unlawful or harmful behaviour.

We do not review all User Content before or after it is posted. We are not responsible for, and do not endorse, any User Content posted by you or by any other user.

### How we can use your User Content

By posting or providing any User Content on or through Wedding Ready, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, and sublicensable licence to:

- use, host, store, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, reformat, translate, create derivative works from, publicly perform, publicly display, make available and otherwise communicate, and distribute your User Content
- use your User Content to operate, maintain, and improve the Service
- use your User Content to promote Wedding Ready, including in our marketing, communications, and case studies.

This licence is granted without any obligation on us to compensate you and without any expectation of payment, unless we expressly agree otherwise in writing.

This licence lasts for as long as your User Content remains on Wedding Ready. If you remove your User Content or delete your account, we will cease actively using that content going forward, except that:

- copies may remain in our systems for a reasonable period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes, and
- we may continue to use your User Content in any materials already created (for example, promotional materials or campaigns that are already in circulation) under a continuing, non-revocable licence for those specific uses.

You also grant us the right to sublicense this licence to our service providers and partners (such as hosting providers, content delivery networks, and analytics providers) to the extent reasonably required for us to provide, secure, and promote the Service.

We will endeavour not to materially distort your User Content when we edit or format it for use on the Service or in our communications.

### How other users can use your User Content

Some features of Wedding Ready allow other users to:

- view, save, or share your User Content
- organise it into collections or mood boards
- click through to your supplier profile or external website.

By posting User Content, you authorise other users to use your User Content within Wedding Ready in these ways. We are not responsible for how other users may reuse or share your User Content outside of Wedding Ready.

### Supplier-specific responsibilities

If you are a supplier, you must:

- only upload content that you own or have a valid licence to use for promotional purposes
- ensure that credits and attributions (for example, to photographers, stylists, venues, and other suppliers) are accurate and not misleading
- promptly correct or remove any User Content that you discover is inaccurate, misleading, or infringing
- comply with all advertising, consumer, and fair trading laws that apply to your business
- ensure that any “before and after” or other comparative content you post is honest, not misleading, and accurately represents your services.

### How long we keep your User Content

Following termination or deactivation of your account, or removal of any User Content from Wedding Ready, we may retain copies of your User Content for a reasonable period of time for backup, archival, and audit purposes.

We and other users may also continue to use, store, display, and share copies of your User Content to the extent it has already been:

- saved by other users into their collections or boards, or
- incorporated into materials that have already been created or published.

### Feedback you provide

We welcome feedback, ideas, and suggestions about Wedding Ready ("Feedback"). If you choose to submit Feedback, you agree that:

- we have no obligation to keep your Feedback confidential
- we may use, adapt, and implement your Feedback for any purpose, including improving the Service, without any payment or compensation to you
- we do not waive any rights to use similar ideas that we already knew about, developed ourselves, or obtained from other sources.

### Reporting content and moderation

We aim to keep Wedding Ready a positive and safe place for couples and suppliers.

You can report content or behaviour that you believe is:

- unlawful
- infringing your intellectual property rights or privacy rights
- abusive, hateful, harmful, or otherwise contrary to these Terms.

When we receive a report, we will review it and take whatever action we consider appropriate, which may include:

- asking the user to modify or remove the content
- hiding, restricting, or removing the content ourselves
- suspending or terminating the relevant account in serious or repeated cases
- where required by law, reporting the matter to relevant authorities.

We may refuse, hide, restrict, or remove any User Content at any time, for any reason, whether or not we have received a report, if we reasonably consider that it breaches these Terms, our policies, or applicable law, or is otherwise inappropriate for our community. We are not required to explain every moderation decision, but where appropriate we may provide a brief explanation or a way for you to respond.

## Intellectual Property

### Your intellectual property

Except for the licence you grant us under section 3(b), you retain ownership of all intellectual property rights you hold in your User Content.

If we use your User Content in our own marketing or communications, we will, where reasonably practicable, credit you or your business.

### Our intellectual property

All rights in and to Wedding Ready (excluding User Content) are owned by us or our licensors. This includes all:

- software, code, and databases
- designs, branding, logos, and trade marks
- layouts, user interfaces, and features
- text, graphics, and other content we create.

You must not use our name, logo, or trade marks without our prior written permission, except as allowed by law (for example, fair dealing).

Nothing in these Terms transfers any ownership of our intellectual property rights to you. We reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms.

## Security

We care about the security of your account and your information.

We will take reasonable steps to protect the security of Wedding Ready, but we cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures.

You agree to:

- keep your login details secure and not share them with anyone else
- choose a strong password and change it if you suspect it has been compromised
- notify us promptly if you become aware of any unauthorised access to your account or any other breach of security.

If you are a supplier or business user, you are responsible for ensuring that only authorised people within your business have access to your account and that departing team members no longer have access.

## Third-party links, sites, and services

Wedding Ready may include links to or integrations with third-party websites, platforms, or services (for example, a supplier’s own website, booking system, or social media profile).

We do not control and are not responsible for:

- the content, products, or services provided by third parties, or
- any loss or damage that may arise from your use of third-party sites or services.

If you access any third-party website, service, or content from Wedding Ready, you do so at your own risk. Third-party sites will have their own terms and privacy policies, which you should read carefully.

## Accounts, suspension, and termination

You may delete your account at any time using the tools we make available or by contacting us.

We may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to Wedding Ready (including your account) if we reasonably believe that:

- you have seriously or repeatedly breached these Terms or our policies
- your use of the Service is causing or is likely to cause harm to us, other users, or third parties
- we are required to do so by law, a court order, or a regulator.

In urgent cases (for example, where we reasonably consider there is a risk of harm, fraud, or serious legal or regulatory risk), we may suspend or restrict access to your account or to certain features immediately and notify you afterwards where appropriate.

Where appropriate and practicable, we will provide you with notice before suspending or terminating your account and, where reasonable, an opportunity to respond.

If your account is deleted:

- your profile and most of your User Content will no longer be visible to other users
- we may retain copies of your User Content and account information for a reasonable period for backup, archival, and audit purposes, as described in these Terms and in our Privacy Policy
- content that has already been saved by other users, or incorporated into materials already created, may continue to exist and be used as described in section 3(e).

If you are a supplier and you delete your account, User Content associated solely with your account may be deleted and cannot be recovered. Couples may no longer be able to access any information you stored only within Wedding Ready.

## Warranties and indemnities

This indemnity is not intended to limit any rights you may have under the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 or any other non-excludable law.

We do not control and are not responsible for the actions or omissions of users or suppliers, including:

- the accuracy of supplier listings, pricing, or availability
- the quality of any goods or services provided by suppliers
- any arrangements, agreements, or disputes between couples and suppliers.

Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude, restrict, or modify any rights you have under the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993, the Fair Trading Act 1986, or any other law that cannot lawfully be excluded or limited.

Where you are using the Service for business purposes, you agree that:

- the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 does not apply, and
- to the extent permitted by law, any guarantees, warranties, or conditions implied by law are excluded.

## Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by New Zealand law, we will not be liable for:

- any loss of profit, revenue, goodwill, or opportunity
- any loss of data, including loss of User Content
- any indirect, consequential, or special loss or damage
- any loss or damage resulting from:
    - your use of, or inability to use, the Service
    - any conduct or content of any other user or third party on the Service
    - unauthorised access to or use of your account or information, where we have taken reasonable security steps.

To the extent we are liable to you and our liability cannot be excluded, our total aggregate liability to you for all claims arising out of or in connection with the Service or these Terms is limited to the greater of:

- the total fees (if any) you have paid to us for use of the Service in the 12 months immediately before the event giving rise to the claim, or
- NZD $100.

This limitation does not apply to any liability we may have which cannot be excluded or limited under New Zealand law (for example, liability for loss or damage caused by our fraud or deliberate misconduct).

## Copyright complaints and takedown process

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect you to do the same.

If you believe that content on Wedding Ready infringes your copyright or other intellectual property rights, you may notify us by providing a written notice that includes:

- your full name and contact details
- a description of the work or material you claim is infringed
- a description of the content on Wedding Ready that you claim is infringing, including a link or other information reasonably sufficient for us to locate it
- a statement that you genuinely believe, on reasonable grounds, that the use of the content is not authorised by you, your agent, or the law
- a statement that the information you have provided is accurate and that you are the rights holder or are authorised to act on behalf of the rights holder.

We may remove or disable access to content that we believe, on reasonable grounds, may infringe the rights of others. Where appropriate, we may notify the user who uploaded the content and provide them with an opportunity to respond.

If you repeatedly upload or share infringing content, we may suspend or terminate your account.

## Privacy and data handling

Our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information about you and your wedding plans are governed by our Privacy Policy, which forms part of these Terms.

In summary, we use your information to:

- operate, maintain, and improve the Service
- personalise your experience and show you relevant content and suppliers
- communicate with you about your account, security, and important updates
- meet our legal obligations.

We store and process data using service providers that may be located in New Zealand or overseas. Where we transfer personal information outside New Zealand, we take reasonable steps to ensure that it is protected by privacy safeguards that are comparable to those in New Zealand law.

We handle personal information in line with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and take reasonable steps to ensure that any comparable privacy safeguards apply where personal information is stored or accessed outside New Zealand.

You have rights under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 to access and request correction of your personal information. Our Privacy Policy explains how to exercise these rights and how to contact us using the privacy contact form linked in the footer of our website.

Please read our Privacy Policy carefully for more detail.

## Changes to the Service and to these Terms

We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time, including by adding or removing features.

We may also update these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes, we will take reasonable steps to notify you (for example, by email or by a notice within the Service) before the changes take effect. The updated Terms will apply from the date stated in the notice.

If you continue to use Wedding Ready after the updated Terms take effect, you will be taken to have accepted them. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you should stop using the Service and delete your account.

## Governing law and disputes

These Terms, and your use of Wedding Ready, are governed by the laws of New Zealand.

You and we agree that the courts of New Zealand will have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim or dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Service, except where applicable law provides you with a non-excludable right to bring a claim in another forum.

Before starting formal proceedings, we encourage you to contact us to attempt to resolve any issue informally.

## General terms

### Entire agreement

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any additional terms that apply to specific features of the Service, form the entire agreement between you and us regarding your use of Wedding Ready and supersede any prior agreements or understandings relating to the Service.

### Severability

If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be modified to the minimum extent necessary or, if modification is not possible, treated as deleted. The rest of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.

### No waiver

If we do not exercise or enforce a right under these Terms, that does not mean we have waived that right. Any waiver must be in writing and will only apply to the specific situation in which it is given.

### Assignment

You may not transfer or assign your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may transfer or assign our rights and obligations under these Terms (for example, in connection with a sale of our business) without your consent. If we do so, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that this does not materially reduce your rights under these Terms.

### Relationship of the parties

Nothing in these Terms creates any partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship between you and us. You and we are independent contracting parties.

### Contact

If you have any questions about these Terms or the Service, or if you wish to give us any notice under these Terms (including copyright complaints), please contact us using the contact details provided in the Wedding Ready app or on our website.
