## About this statement

This Privacy Statement explains how Wedding Ready collects, uses, stores, and protects your personal information when you use our platform, website, and related services (together, the "Service"). It is intended to be read alongside our Terms of Use. When we say "we", "us", or "our" in this Privacy Statement, we are referring to the operator of Wedding Ready.

By using Wedding Ready, you agree that we may collect, use, and share your information as described in this Privacy Statement and in line with New Zealand privacy law, including the Privacy Act 2020.

---

**Put simply**

This page explains what information we collect about you, how we use it, and your rights under New Zealand privacy law.



## The information we collect

We collect personal information from you when you use Wedding Ready. This includes information about your:

- name
- contact information (such as email address and, where provided, phone number)
- location (for example, your general region, city, or wedding location)
- computer, device, or network (such as IP address, device identifiers, browser type, and basic technical diagnostics)
- interactions with us and with the Service (such as tiles you view or save, suppliers you view or contact, searches you run, and features you use)
- billing or purchase information if you pay for any services through Wedding Ready (such as subscription details, limited payment information, and transaction history).

We may also collect:

- information you choose to submit through forms (such as contact, feedback, or privacy request forms)
- information contained in your User Content (for example, photos, descriptions, reviews, and comments you upload to Wedding Ready)
- information about how you interact with emails or other messages we send you (such as whether you opened or clicked on them).

Where you use third-party sign-in options (such as Google or Apple), we receive certain basic information from those providers so that we can create and manage your account.

We generally collect information directly from you. We may also collect some information automatically when you use the Service, and we may obtain limited information from third parties where this is reasonably necessary for providing or securing the Service.

---

**Put simply**

We collect basic contact details, activity on Wedding Ready, and limited device and billing information so we can run the service and understand how it is used.



## How we use your information

We use your personal information to operate, secure, and improve Wedding Ready, and to provide you with a useful and personalised experience. In particular, we use your information to:

- create and manage your user account
- personalise your experience and show content relevant to your location, preferences, and activity on Wedding Ready
- support and enable core platform features (for example, saving tiles, managing moodboards, and connecting with suppliers)
- improve the feed, search results, and recommendations over time, including by analysing how users interact with tiles and suppliers
- send important service updates, support messages, and transactional emails (such as account confirmations, security alerts, billing notices, and changes to our policies)
- respond to your questions, feedback, and requests
- maintain security, prevent and detect fraudulent or abusive activity, and enforce our Terms of Use and other policies
- analyse usage trends and improve the platform’s performance, reliability, design, and features
- comply with our legal obligations and respond to lawful requests from regulators or other authorities.

We also may use information about how you use Wedding Ready (including tiles you view or save, suppliers you view, searches you run, and moodboards you create) to build inferences about your interests and preferences. We may use these inferences to rank and recommend tiles and suppliers we think will be most relevant to you.

We may use your information to detect, investigate, and prevent fraud, abuse, spam, security incidents, and breaches of our Terms of Use, and to protect the rights, safety, and property of Wedding Ready, our users, suppliers, and the public.

We may use personal information, often in aggregated or de-identified form, to run analytics and product experiments so we can test and improve features like the feed, search, and supplier discovery.

We may combine information we collect about you from different sources (for example, from your use of the app and your interactions with our emails) where this is necessary to achieve these purposes and consistent with New Zealand privacy law.

---

**Put simply**

We use your information to run and secure Wedding Ready, personalise what you see, improve the product, communicate with you, and meet our legal obligations.



## Sharing your information

### Our team and service providers

Besides our own staff and contractors who need access to perform their roles, we share your personal information with trusted service providers who help us provide and run Wedding Ready. This may include:

- authentication providers (for example, Google or Apple) to enable secure sign-in
- cloud hosting, storage, and computing providers
- email delivery and communication tools
- analytics and performance monitoring providers
- payment and billing providers (for suppliers and any paid services)
- security and fraud prevention tools.

We require our service providers to protect your information and to use it only for the purposes we specify.

### Suppliers and other users

We do not sell your personal information to suppliers.

We may share information with suppliers in the following limited way:

- we provide suppliers with aggregated or anonymised insights about how their tiles or content perform (for example, how many times a tile has been viewed or saved). These insights do not identify you personally, and we will not attempt to re-identify individuals from this data.

We do not share identifiable personal information about you with suppliers unless you choose to provide it yourself (for example, by clicking through to a supplier’s website, completing their contact form, or otherwise contacting them off-platform). When you do this, any information you give directly to the supplier will be governed by the supplier’s own terms and privacy policy.

Other users may be able to see certain information you choose to make public on Wedding Ready (for example, your supplier profile, business name, and any public-facing User Content you upload). You should only share information publicly that you are comfortable being visible to others.

### Legal and safety reasons

We may disclose your information if we reasonably believe this is necessary to:

- comply with the law or with a court order, warrant, or other legal process
- respond to lawful requests from regulators or enforcement agencies
- protect the rights, property, or safety of Wedding Ready, our users, suppliers, or the public
- detect, investigate, or prevent fraud, security issues, or abuse of the Service.

Where it is lawful and reasonable for us to do so, we will consider whether we can let you know before or shortly after we make this kind of disclosure.

### Business changes

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganisation, sale of assets, or similar transaction, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any new holder of your information continues to protect it in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Statement and New Zealand privacy law.

---

**Put simply**

We share your information with trusted providers who help us run Wedding Ready, give suppliers anonymous performance insights, and may disclose information when the law or safety requires it. We do not sell your personal information.



## Advertising and analytics

We do not sell your personal information.

We may use third-party tools (such as Google or Meta advertising products) to help us understand how people discover Wedding Ready and to show ads about Wedding Ready to people who may be interested in it. For example, we may share a hashed version of your email address or other limited identifiers with these providers so they can show Wedding Ready ads to you or to "lookalike" audiences with similar characteristics.

We do not use data about your wider browsing activity on other websites to personalise the content or recommendations you see on Wedding Ready, beyond what those third-party advertising providers do within their own systems in line with their privacy policies.

We may create aggregated or de-identified information (for example, statistics about how tiles perform or how often features are used). We use this information to understand and improve Wedding Ready and, where relevant, to provide insights to suppliers. We will not attempt to re-identify individuals from aggregated or de-identified information.

---

**Put simply**

We use common advertising and analytics tools to understand how people find Wedding Ready and to promote it, but we do not sell your data or use your wider web browsing to personalise what you see on Wedding Ready.



## Optional information and what happens if you do not provide it

You can choose not to provide certain information to us. However, some information is necessary for us to provide core parts of the Service.

For example, if you choose not to enter:

- the information needed to create an account (such as an email address), we will be unable to provide you with account access
- information such as your wedding location or region, we may not be able to provide a personalised feed or show you the most relevant suppliers.

Where we ask you for information, we will usually tell you whether it is required for a particular feature or is optional.

## How we store and protect your information

We take reasonable steps to keep your personal information safe from loss, unauthorised access, use, modification, or disclosure.

We do this by, for example:

- storing information in secure, encrypted cloud systems
- limiting access to personal information to people who need it to do their job or provide the Service
- using technical safeguards such as access controls, monitoring, and security tools
- reviewing our security practices regularly.

However, no online service can be guaranteed as completely secure. To help protect your information, you should:

- keep your login details secure and not share them with anyone else
- choose a strong password and change it if you suspect it has been compromised
- tell us promptly if you become aware of any unauthorised access to your account or other security issue.

We retain personal information only for as long as we reasonably need it for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement or as required by law. After that, we take reasonable steps to delete it or to store it in a form that does not personally identify you.

---

**Put simply**

We use secure systems and access controls to protect your information, but no online service is perfect, so you also need to protect your login and let us know if something looks wrong.



## Where your information is stored and sent

We use service providers that may be located in New Zealand or overseas. This means your personal information may be stored or accessed in countries other than New Zealand.

Where we transfer personal information outside New Zealand, we take reasonable steps to ensure that it is protected by privacy safeguards that are comparable to those in the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020. This may include using contractual protections or choosing providers in countries with similar legal protections.

---

**Put simply**

Your information may be stored overseas, but we require similar privacy protections to those in New Zealand law wherever it goes.



## Your rights and how to exercise them

You have rights under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, including the right to:

- ask for a copy of any personal information we hold about you
- ask us to correct any personal information that you believe is wrong or incomplete.

If you would like to request a copy of your information, or ask for a correction, please contact us using the privacy contact form linked in the footer of our website or through the contact options provided in the Wedding Ready app. We may need to verify your identity before we can respond to your request.

In some cases, we may be unable to provide you with certain information (for example, where doing so would unreasonably affect another person’s privacy or would breach our legal obligations). If that happens, we will explain why, to the extent we are reasonably able to do so.

You can also:

- manage some of your information directly through your account settings
- unsubscribe from non-essential emails by using the unsubscribe link in those emails (we will still send you important transactional or service messages when necessary).

---

**Put simply**

You can ask to see the information we hold about you, ask us to fix it if it is wrong, manage some settings yourself, and opt out of non-essential emails.



## Children and young people

Wedding Ready is not intended for use by children under 13, and any use by people aged 13 to 17 must be with the consent of a parent or legal guardian, as described in our Terms of Use.

Where we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without appropriate consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information.

If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe that we may have collected personal information about your child in a way that concerns you, please contact us using the privacy contact form linked in the footer of our website.

---

**Put simply**

Wedding Ready is for adults and older teens with guardian consent. If we learn we hold information about younger children without proper consent, we will delete it.



## Third-party sites and services

Wedding Ready may link to or integrate with third-party websites, platforms, or services (for example, a supplier’s own website, booking system, or social media profile).

If you follow a link to any third-party site or service, or choose to share information directly with a third party, their own terms and privacy policies will apply. We are not responsible for how third parties handle your information.

We encourage you to read the privacy statements of any third-party sites or services that you use in connection with your wedding planning.

## Changes to this Privacy Statement

We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes in our Service, our practices, or applicable law.

When we make material changes, we will take reasonable steps to let you know (for example, by email or by a notice within the Service) before the updated Privacy Statement takes effect. The updated version will be published in the Wedding Ready app and/or on our website with an updated "Published" date.

If you continue to use Wedding Ready after the updated Privacy Statement takes effect, you will be taken to have accepted the updated terms. If you do not agree with the changes, you should stop using the Service and, if you wish, delete your account.

---

**Put simply**

We may update this Privacy Statement as our service or the law changes. We will try to let you know about important updates, and using Wedding Ready after that means you accept the new version.



## Contact us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, our privacy practices, or how we handle your personal information, or if you wish to make a request or complaint, please contact us using the privacy contact form linked in the footer of our website or through the contact options provided in the Wedding Ready app.

We will aim to respond within a reasonable time and in line with our obligations under New Zealand privacy law.
