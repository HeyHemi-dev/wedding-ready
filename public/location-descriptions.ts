    title: 'Northland Wedding Suppliers',
    description:
      'Northland feels like the New Zealand summer that never ends. With subtropical warmth, golden beaches, and sleepy towns that slow the pace of life, it’s a region where weddings feel less like a formal event and more like a relaxed gathering of people you love. You might find yourself barefoot at a ceremony on Tāpeka Point or celebrating under pōhutukawa trees with the scent of salt and sunscreen in the air. The region’s beauty lies in its contrast—ancient Waipoua Forest meets secluded coves, Māori culture runs deep, and the light up here has a hazy, painterly quality. Northland suits couples who want to make space for connection, and who aren’t afraid to let nature (and weather) take the lead.',

    title: 'Auckland Wedding Suppliers',
    description:
      'Auckland might be a city, but it wears many faces. You’ve got wild west coast beaches like Piha, sunlit vineyards in Kumeū, bustling urban venues, and tucked-away heritage spots—all within an hour’s drive. It’s the kind of place where your wedding could start with a skyline view and end with barefoot dancing on a black sand beach. Planning here means plenty of options and a strong supplier network, but also a few logistics to wrangle (hello traffic). For couples who love contrast—urban energy mixed with coastal calm—Tāmaki Makaurau can deliver a day that reflects your whole story.',

    title: 'Bay of Plenty Wedding Suppliers',
    description:
      'There’s a brightness to the Bay of Plenty—citrus orchards, white-sand beaches, and laid-back towns that hum with coastal energy. It’s the kind of place where your guests might sneak in a morning swim at Pilot Bay before the ceremony or stretch the celebration out over a long weekend. With Tauranga’s growing city amenities, Mount Maunganui’s beach-town buzz, and inland gems like Ōpōtiki and Katikati, the Bay caters to everything from barefoot elopements to vineyard feasts. It suits couples who want sun-soaked ease without sacrificing good coffee or great views.',

Gisborne is for those who want their day to feel connected—to whenua, to people, and to pace.',

Sun-soaked hills, Art Deco charm, and a wine scene that punches well above its weight make it a dream for couples chasing a refined, yet relaxed celebration. Think: long tables under olive trees in Havelock North, golden-hour portraits among the vines, and guests sipping syrah on sun-drenched lawns. Napier and Hastings provide stylish backdrops, but the magic is often found a little off the beaten track.',

  [Location.TARANAKI]: {
    title: 'Taranaki Wedding Suppliers',
    description:
      'There’s something bold about a Taranaki wedding—maybe it’s the moody coastline, or that iconic maunga always watching in the background. It’s a region that feels both dramatic and down-to-earth, with its mix of surf, art, and strong community ties. New Plymouth brings the creative energy, but drive 20 minutes and you’ll find yourself on the Forgotten World Highway or at a windswept black-sand beach.

From the golden bays of Abel Tasman to the arty buzz of Mapua and Nelson itself, the region blends nature and creativity in a way that’s hard to beat.
